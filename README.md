# Introduction
This repository contains a collection of data science projects completed for self-practice. The projects cover various topics in data science and machine learning, including classification, regression, and anomaly detection. Each project is sourced from Kaggle and includes detailed analysis, code, and documentation.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Iris Dataset Analysis
**Objective**: Classify iris flowers into species based on sepal and petal dimensions.
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Iris Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris)
- **Techniques**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Classification Models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees)

### 2. Titanic Survival Prediction
**Objective**: Predict survival on the Titanic based on passenger data.
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic)
- **Techniques**: Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Classification Models (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machines)

### 3. Credit Card Fraud Detection
**Objective**: Detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)
- **Techniques**: Imbalanced Data Handling, Anomaly Detection Models (e.g., Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor)
